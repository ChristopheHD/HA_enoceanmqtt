EnOceanMQTT is the core of HA_enoceanmqtt. It manages the EnOcean protocol through the USB300 dongle thanks to the [Python EnOcean library](https://github.com/kipe/enocean).  

The Python EnOcean library is based on an EEP.xml file which contains the definition of the supported EnOcean EEPs.  
As for EnOceanMQTT, it needs a configuration file in which are indicated among other things the MQTT parameters as well as the EnOcean devices to manage.  
The Home Assistant overlay is in charge of creating automatically and managing MQTT devices in Home Assistant. It maps an EnOcean device to one or more MQTT devices in HA thanks to a mapping file.
